    <h2>Classification by Function</h2>
    <article>
      <h3>Conjugation</h3>
      <p>
        Many words appearing in Satu Kitan sentences are found in the dictionary with one additional character.
        The added character corresponds to the part of speech, and there are four types.

      <p>
        This kind of word change is called <dfn>conjugation</dfn>.
        In Satu Kitan, there are no words that conjugate irregularly.

      <h3>Part of Speech</h3>
      <p>
        In Satu Kitan, parts of speech are less likely to be classified by meaning compared to other languages, and
        mainly indicate <b>syntactic function</b>.
        Because of this, most words conjugate into multiple parts of speech.
      </p>
      <h4>Noun</h4>
      <p>
        The dictionary form of the word. It represents the name of things or concepts, and also nominalized verbs (such
        as "to do", "doing") are expressed as nouns.
      </p>
      <h4>Verb</h4>
      <p>
        The word with <span lang="kt">s</span> added to the dictionary form.
        In Satu Kitan, all predicates are expressed as verbs.
        Besides actions and states, it can represent conceptual units or simply serve as a grammatical marker.
      </p>
      <h4>Modifier</h4>
      <p>
        The word with <span lang="kt">v</span> added to the dictionary form.
        It functions like adjectives or particles in other languages, and is used to add states or properties to nouns
        or verbs in sentences.
      </p>
      <h4>Conjunction</h4>
      <p>
        The word with <span lang="kt">f</span> added to the dictionary form.
        Conjunctions and verbs have exactly the same meaning; only their syntactic function is different.

    <h2>Classification by Meaning</h2>
    <article>
      <h3>Meaning Type</h3>
      <p>
        While parts of speech classify words by syntactic function, <dfn>meaning type</dfn> classifies words by their
        semantic category.
        Each meaning type determines which parts of speech the word can conjugate into.
        There are five types of meaning.
      </p>
      <h4>Process Word</h4>
      <p>
        Words that express <b>actions involving change</b> or <b>the process of change</b>. They conjugate into all
        parts of speech.
        Typically, the consonant of the last syllable is <span lang="kt">k</span> (k).
        <br />
        Generally, process words and result words exist as pairs differing only in the consonant of the last syllable
        (e.g., <span lang="kt">kika</span> / to be proven and <span lang="kt">kita</span> / correct).
      </p>
      <h4>Result Word</h4>
      <p>
        Words that express the <b>state after some change</b> or the <b>property added by it</b>. They conjugate into
        all parts of speech.
        The final consonant of the last syllable is <span lang="kt">t</span> (t).
      </p>
      <h4>Function Word</h4>
      <p>
        Words that are neither process nor result words, and conjugate as verbs. They conjugate into all parts of
        speech.<br />
        Instantaneous actions, continuous actions, and states with undefined beginning or end are classified as function
        words.
      </p>
      <h4>Name Word</h4>
      <p>
        Words that represent <b>names of things or concepts</b>. They conjugate as nouns and modifiers.<br />
        As modifiers, they have almost the same meaning as "A's" or "of A" in English, broadly expressing belonging,
        ownership, cause, etc. of the modified target.
      </p>
      <h4>Complement Word</h4>
      <p>
        Words that generally do not stand alone, and function like particles or prepositions such as "to" or "by".
        They are used only as modifiers, appearing in sentences as <dfn>complement object</dfn>.
        For details on complement objects, see the grammar page.
      </p>
      <h4>Image of Process, Result, and Function Words</h4>
      <p>
        Process, result, and function words partially express <dfn>aspect</dfn> by this classification itself.
        Note that this is different from tense such as past or present.
        <br />
        The following diagram is an image graph showing the range expressed by each word, using <span
          class="red">process word "<span lang="kt">dikas</span> (dikas) / increase"</span> and <span
          class="blue">result word "<span lang="kt">ditas</span> (ditas) / many"</span> as examples.
        Time flows from left to right, and the Y-axis of the graph represents "the amount at that point in time".
      </p>

          <text x="220" y="27" lang="kt" style="font-size:1rem; fill: #217BDF;">ditas</text>
        </svg>
      </div>
      <p>
        The process word <span lang="kt" class="red">dikas</span> is dynamic, expressing the <b>action</b> of increasing
        and the <b>process of change</b> of currently increasing.
        In contrast, the result word <span lang="kt" class="blue">ditas</span> is static, expressing the <b>result</b>
        after increasing and the <b>property</b> of "many" obtained by it.<br />
        Process and result words are thus causally connected, with the goal of the process word becoming the start of
        the result word.
        However, note that expressions such as "endless process word" (increasing forever) and "result word without a
        clear cause" (many without a clear beginning) are also allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many words expressing actions or states that cannot form such process/result word pairs are classified as
        <b>function words</b>.
        This includes conceptual words like "<span lang="kt">gas</span> (gas) / be affirmed" and words like "<span
          lang="kt">pogis</span> (pogis) / be interesting" where the start or end of the action or state cannot be
        defined.
